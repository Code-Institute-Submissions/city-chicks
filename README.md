# CITY-CHICKS README
City chicks aims to provide resources and ideas for those wanting to start rearing chickens in their
backyards, in an urban environment. The idea is to help save the planet and be kinder to animals (even
a small bit counts!)

# UX
The user stories I  came up with for this site are as follows:

1. As a website visitor I want to learn about keeping chickens So that I can grow my own eggs and reduce my carbon footprint
2. As a mother I want to find wholesome activities for my children so that I can teach them good values
3. As a budding city chicken farmer I want to find out what events exist so that I can meet people and build a support system

## Features
### Existing Features

1. The event sign up page allows budding city chicken farmers and parents to sign up to events where they can meet people and build a support system
2. The website has information about how to go about starting a hen rearing project in one's backyard.

### Future Additions
- Community map where people can register themselves to host events and also show their location on a Google Map
- accordion on small screen hidden for the safety page, this needs to be incorporated
- accordion on small screen for getting started page not styled nicely, can be improved


## Technologies used
- Bootstrap https://getbootstrap.com/docs/4.0/getting-started/introduction/
- CSS https://devdocs.io/css/   
- HTML https://devdocs.io/html/
- Font Awesome https://fontawesome.com/v4.7.0/   


## Testing
- clicked on all links to make sure they go to the correct path, where the did not, I updated the paths accordingly
- burger menu icon was appearing when scaling down screen size to medium, but the menu items were not collapsing.  I had to change the breakpoint of the collapse field to fix this.

- Sign up form: tried to submit the form with an incorrect email address (no at sign), this did not allow me to submit the form, so was working as expected.
