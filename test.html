                        you want to be more adventurous, you can adopt hens after they have been rescued from battery farms.
                        Below are links to where you can get either of these and also some pros and cons you should consider
                        before making your choice.

                        keep an eye on them and visit them as often as you are able to, to make sure they are getting on 
                        alright.
